  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 (backend credential verification) and REQ-2 (frontend login form with session management). The backend adds verifyAdminCredentials via stable state and migration, and the frontend adds a login form, session hook, and logout button. Most acceptance criteria are met, but the backend function to allow the owner to change credentials is not evidenced in the diff, and credentials are stored as plain text rather than hashed.",

      "requirement": "Provide a default username and password that can be changed by the owner.",
      "reason": "The diff shows default credentials stored in stable state and via migration, but no exposed function (e.g., setAdminCredentials) allowing the owner to change the credentials at runtime is visible in the truncated backend/main.mo diff.",

      "requirement": "Store the credentials securely in stable state (hashed or as a stable variable).",
