When a user navigates to the admin dashboard route, show a centered login form with username and password fields and a 'Login' button before granting access to the dashboard. On successful credential verification via the backend, store a session flag (e.g., in React state or sessionStorage) and render the dashboard. On failure, display an inline error message ('Invalid username or password'). Include a 'Logout' button inside the dashboard that clears the session and returns to the login screen.",
