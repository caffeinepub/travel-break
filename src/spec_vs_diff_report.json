The diff summary also claims Hotels and Sales Store pages received subtle background accents. However, the required static image assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` are not present in the diff (no added files). Several unrelated business/auth/currency/query features were also modified/added, which were explicitly out of scope.",
